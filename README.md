- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties
- Fleexbox
- CSS-grid

## What I learned üí°
This project was helpful to consolidate my knowledge about HTML5 and CSS3. 

In the CSS file, I tried as much as possible to select the desired element using advanced selectors and pseudo-classes, which was one of the subjects studied during the discipline of Web Development I.

To animate the cards when the mouse is over them, I used the child combinator ``>`` associated with the pseudo-class ``:hover``
```CSS
.cards > div:hover {
    transform: scale(1.04, 1.04);
    box-shadow: 3px 2px 5px rgb(85, 111, 134);
}

```
To apply the margin-top property from the second card onwards, on the mobile layout, I used the  pseudo-class ``:nth-of-type(n)`` associated with the general sibling selector ``~``
```CSS
.top-destinations div:nth-of-type(1)~div, .best-deals div:nth-of-type(1)~div {
    margin-top: .75em;
}
```
In addition to those I mentioned, there were other examples of using the pseudo-classes and advanced selectors, like the adjacent sibling selector ``+``, the pseudo-class ``:first-of-type``, ``last-of-type``, ``:nth-child(n)``.

### üõ†Ô∏è Continued development
- Developing other pages to the website, like the Login page.
